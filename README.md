SaaS devops bot - the smart zombie for your cloud


**Note**
This was a hack for LeedsHack 2012, the code is a horrible mess, and attempting to dynamically deploy Github's Hubot was a lot harder than originally expected.
I did come out of it with a redis backed Hubot config plugin and a Mediaburst-powered SMS plugin, which in the next week I will release, but stay tuned to this repo for a future improved release of `zom` itself after I've either cleaned up the code or rejigged it to use a different bot engine, e.g. either it's own or something like my own `hippybot` project.
